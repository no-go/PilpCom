# Pilp Com

I try to build a Pip-Boy for real live without game interaction. Maybe it is an idea for cosplay or role play.

Features:

- display day, time, vibration detector
- list contacts (option to send sms or make a call)
- list received sms and other messages with special rights
- get location and show a map
- a single text only rss feed reader and internet radio player

You can swith trough the views with android bluetooth keyboard via cursor keys or:

- **K** Clk (clock)
- **I** Who (contacts)
- **J** Msg (SMS and other messages)
- **M** Area (OSM map)
- **O** News (RSS reader and internet radio)

Names and design is different to the original app and interface. I not want any copyright trouble.

## Todo

- tool to build sms with default text blocks via an easy bluetooth control keyboard device
